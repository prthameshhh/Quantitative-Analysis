 # Quantitative Stock Analysis  

This repository contains code and analysis for performing quantitative analysis on stocks from four major sectors in the National Stock Exchange (NSE): FMCG, Banking, Healthcare, and Energy. Below is an overview of the analyses performed and the contents of this repository.

## Contents

1. **Data Analysis Notebook**:
    - `Quantitative_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for quantitative analysis of stock data.

 
3. **Output Files**:
    - `correlation_matrix.png`: Heatmap visualization of the correlation matrix of closing prices for stocks from different sectors.
    - `volatility_bar_chart.png`: Bar chart visualization of the volatility (standard deviation) of closing prices for stocks from different sectors.
    - `risk_return_scatter_plot.png`: Scatter plot visualization of risk vs. return analysis for stocks from different sectors.

## Analyses Performed

1. **Correlation Analysis**:
    - Analyzed the correlation between the closing prices of stocks from different sectors to understand the relationships between them.

2. **Volatility Analysis**:
    - Calculated the volatility (standard deviation) of closing prices for stocks from different sectors to assess the risk associated with each sector.

3. **Overall Percentage Return Analysis**:
    - Calculated the overall percentage return for stocks from each sector over a specified period to evaluate the performance of each sector.

4. **Risk vs. Return Analysis**:
    - Analyzed the relationship between risk (standard deviation) and return (average daily return) for stocks from different sectors to understand their risk-return profiles.

## Instructions for Use

1. **Setup**:
    - Clone this repository to your local machine.
    - Open the `stock_analysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook using JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook.

2. **Run Analysis**:
    - Follow the instructions in the notebook to run various quantitative analyses on the provided stock data.

3. **View Results**:
    - View the generated visualizations (`correlation_matrix.png`, `volatility_bar_chart.png`, `risk_return_scatter_plot.png`) to understand the results of the quantitative analyses.

4. **Customization**:
    - Modify the analysis code as needed to analyze different datasets or adjust analysis parameters.
